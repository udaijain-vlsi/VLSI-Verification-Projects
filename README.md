## 📂 Projects  

### 1. 4-bit Synchronous Counter  
**Folder: `./counter-verification/`**  

- **Overview**: Clock-driven counter with reset and increment logic.  
- **Design**: RTL module using Verilog non-blocking assignments.  
- **Verification**: Full testbench with clock generation, stimulus, and reset scenarios.  
- **Simulation**: ModelSim waveform shows correct increment up to overflow and reset behavior.  
- **Learned**: Clock synchronization, testbench writing, basic verification flows.  

---

### 2. Synchronous FIFO Verification  
**Folder: `./fifo-verification/`**  

- **Overview**: 8-deep FIFO with read/write pointers and full/empty flags.  
- **Design**: Dual-port RAM with flag logic and LED indicator on full condition.  
- **Verification**: Testbench covers write, read, concurrent operations, and flag transitions.  
- **Simulation**: ModelSim waveform validates full/empty flags and LED glow.  
- **Learned**: Pointer arithmetic, flag generation, verification techniques.

### 3. Overlapping 101 Sequence Detector  
**Folder: `./sequence-detector/`**  

- **Overview**: Moore FSM detecting 101 pattern with overlapping support.  
- **Design**: Four states (S0-S3) with error signaling and 7-segment output.  
- **Verification**: Testbench injects valid/invalid sequences; checks detected, error, and display.  
- **Simulation**: ModelSim waveform confirms overlapping detection and error handling.  
- **Learned**: FSM design, combinational outputs, state transitions.  

---

## 🔧 Tools & Environment  
- **HDL**: Verilog  
- **Simulator**: ModelSim (waveform analysis, testbench debugging)  
- **IDE**: VS Code (syntax highlighting)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (organized folders, commit history)
