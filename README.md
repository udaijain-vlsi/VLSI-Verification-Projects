## 📂 Projects  

### 1. 4-bit Synchronous Counter  
**Folder: `./counter-verification/`**  

- Clock-driven RTL with reset and increment  
- Full testbench + ModelSim simulation  
- Waveform: Verified increment & reset logic  
- Learned: Non-blocking assignments, clock generation, basic verification  

---

### 2. Synchronous FIFO Verification  
**Folder: `./fifo-verification/`**  

- 8-deep FIFO with full/empty flags  
- Custom LED glow on full condition  
- Simulated in ModelSim – waveform shows write/read flow  
- Learned: Pointer arithmetic, flag generation, verification techniques  

---

### 3. Overlapping 101 Sequence Detector  
**Folder: `./sequence-detector/`**  

- Moore FSM detecting 101 pattern with error signaling  
- 7-segment output ('D' / 'E')  
- Simulated in ModelSim – waveform verified  
- Learned: FSM design, state transitions, combinational logic  

---
### 4. 4-bit ALU  
**Folder: `./alu-verification/`**  

- Arithmetic & logic operations with zero flag  
- Simulated in ModelSim – waveform verified
